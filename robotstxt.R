#We found vacationrentalslbi.com has an extensive list
#of rentals, and doesnâ€™t restrict to the particular

#place to gather our data. Naturally, we would like to 
#be polite, so check that we are allowed to scrape. 
#We can see from the R robotstxt library, which indicates 
#that paths_allowed is TRUE, that we are good to go with 
#our intended link.

# Robots.txt says okay to scrape
